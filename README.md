# Common Issues

Let's discuss common issues we see new devs struggle with. These are roughly in order of importance.


## Troubleshooting

Seemingly the hardest thing for new devs to get a hang of.


### WHAT DO I DO FIRST?

-   This is really stressful for new devs
-   Where do I start?
-   What questions should I ask?
-   How do I proceed?


### The wayward plane problem

-   A blue plane flies for a while
-   Eventually they fly towards a red plane
-   The red plane engages and shoots them down
-   Why is this happening?


### Audience Participation

-   What steps should you take to solve this?
-   Who do you need to talk to? (other programmers, testers, or SMEs?)
-   And what questions should you ask them?


### General steps

-   Understand the problem as best you can
-   Talk to the reporter
-   Try to reproduce it as best you can
-   Then start coming up with possible theories


### Solution

-   How long has it been flying?
-   Where is it going?
-   Why does it go in the direction it goes in?
-   It needs fuel and that is the direction of the refueling aircraft


## Debugging

This doesn't get enough love because it is boring. But this is vital.


### Print statements, the old stand by

This works, but it isn't great. Sometimes this is all you can do, but this should be a last resort.


### Web Debuggers

-   Chrome/firefox are the standard
-   There are other tools like Postman that make this easier
-   This is both easier and more painful than more powerful debuggers


### IDE Debuggers

-   Vs Code
-   Eclipse
-   Pycharm
-   Emacs/Vim


### Terminal Debuggers

-   GDB
-   JDB


## Poor Note Taking

-   It is easy and yet seemingly impossible
-   Just write shit down
-   You can always clean up your notes later
-   Use Emacs+OrgMode or Obsidian or whatever Vim has, but use something


## Looking Dumb and Asking Questions

-   You can't make it through without asking questions
-   You will look dumb or clueless, sorry
-   Trying to impress us won't work
-   Humility gets you a lot farther than you think


## Avoiding the command line

-   Using git
-   Using emacs or vim
-   Mastering bash

# General advice

Advice that will help you no matter where you go.


## Learn Emacs (or Vim)

-   Eclipse, visual studio, netBeans, intelliJ, atom, etc
-   All have waxed and waned in popularity
-   Emacs and Vim remain constant


## Take good notes

-   Use org mode
-   Or obsidian
-   Or a lot of paper


## Advice on "the flow"

-   When starting on a project do simple tutorials on your own time.
-   They should be based on principles used in your project.
-   Effective naming is harder than you realize, even after you realize this.
-   Always add annotated documentation to your classes and methods.
-   Use small commits. Get small bits working, commit, repeat.
-   If you need to back something out, small bits are easier.

# Getting your 1st job

Notes on what to do and what not to do.


## Tips for interviewing

-   Do NOT USE AI!
-   We look for potential
-   We aren't expecting you to be super stars
-   We are expecting you to be able to learn
-   Learn to say "I don't know"


## Side projects

-   It is a good idea to have a github account
-   Collect magic spells
-   Save your customizations
-   Setup a plex server/pi hole/MAME cabinet/whatever
-   Do something you enjoy


## Security+

-   This is so much more useful than you think
-   This leads to getting a clearance
-   And that leads to all types of job opportunities
