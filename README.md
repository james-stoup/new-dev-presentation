# Common Issues

Let's discuss common issues we see new devs struggle with.
These are roughly in order of importance.


# Issue #1 - Troubleshooting

The hardest thing for new devs to figure out.


## WHAT DO I DO FIRST???

-   Where do I start?
-   What should I ask?
-   How do I proceed?


## The wayward plane problem

-   A blue plane flies for a while
-   Eventually they fly towards a red plane
-   The red plane engages and shoots them down
-   Why is this happening?


## Audience participation

-   What steps should you take first?
-   What questions should you ask?
-   Who do you need to talk to?


## Steps to Solve

-   Understand the problem
-   Replicate in small scale
-   Scale up as needed
-   Test possible theories


# Issue #2 - Debugging

The boring but vital part


## Print statements, the prison shiv of debugging

Your tool of last resort.
This works, but should only be done in desperation.


## Web Debuggers

-   Chrome/firefox are the standard
-   Check out other tools like Postman
-   This is both easier and more painful than "real" debuggers


## Debuggers

-   VS Code
-   Eclipse
-   Pycharm
-   Emacs/Vim
-   GDB/JDB


# Issue #3 - Note Taking

So easy and yet seemingly impossible


## Types of note taking

-   level 0 - FUCK NOTES, I'LL REMEMBER IT ALL!
-   level 1 - Pen & Paper
-   level 2 - Literally any software
-   level 3 - Org Roam, Personal Wiki, Zettelkasten Method, etc


## What should I write down?

-   Job specific details
-   General knowledge
-   Daily log


## What tools should I take notes with?

-   Emacs + OrgMode
-   Obsidian
-   Whatever Vim has
-   Use something portable


# Issue #4 - Avoiding the command line

-   Learn Emacs or Vim
-   Become proficient at Git
-   Start mastering bash (or powershell)


# General advice

Advice that will help you no matter where you go


## Playing the game

-   Participate in meetings
-   Ask questions
-   Make friends
-   Try not to burn bridges


## Advice on "the flow"

-   Do simple tutorials first
-   They should be based on principles used in your project
-   Effective naming is harder than you realize, even after you realize this
-   Add annotated documentation to your classes/methods
-   Get small bits working, commit, repeat


# Getting your 1st job

Notes on what to do and what not to do


## Side projects

-   Get a github account
-   Collect magic spells
-   Save your customizations
-   Setup a plex server/pi hole/MAME cabinet/whatever
-   Do something you enjoy


## Tips for interviewing

-   DO NOT USE AI!
-   We look for potential
-   We aren't expecting you to be superstars
-   We are expecting you to be able to learn


## Security+

-   It is $425 normally, but they offer a student discount
-   It is good for 1 year
-   This is so much more useful than you think
-   This leads to getting a clearance
-   And that leads to all types of job opportunities
